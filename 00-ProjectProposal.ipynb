    "How are different styles of social media use, passive consumption versus active interaction, associated with wellbeing outcomes among adults aged 18+? We define passive consumption as behaviors like time spent browsing content and viewing posts or short form videos, and active interaction as behaviors like posting, commenting, liking, and direct messaging. Our primary wellbeing outcomes are self reported stress and self reported happiness, and we will also examine sleep related and basic physical health indicators when available. To reduce confounding in this observational study, we will control for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle variables such as physical activity and work hours. We will use regression based statistical inference to estimate associations and will avoid causal claims."

    "Social media uses are now a major component of everyday life. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Snapchat have accrued daily engagement of the majority of adults. As social media use has grown, research has shifted towards focusing on the manner in which individuals engage with it. For this study, we are using a widely adopted distinction which identifies active interaction as including posting content, commenting, liking, and direct messaging. On the other hand, passive consumption includes browsing feeds or watching short-term videos Our initial research suggests that these usage styles may influence different psychological mechanisms with passive use often linked to social comparison and envy, while active use may have higher perceived support and social connectedness. However, associations with other wellbeing outcomes including stress, happiness, sleep quality, and physical health remain mixed and motivates further investigation.\n\nOne prior influential effort in this study is the Social Media Activity Questionnaire (SMAQ), which surveyed 1,230 participants derived from Facebook Activity Questionnaire. This study by Ozimek, Brailovskaia and Bierhoff separated actions identified as active and passive engagements with a rating scale from 1 to 5.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) With the application of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify behavioral dimensions, outcomes regarding mental health were assessed using established scales. These include Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). In contrast to our project, this study focused on negative mental health indicators, rather than trying to estimate well being directly which remains  our priority. Research outcome displayed stronger association between active use depression, anxiety and stress, while passive was more strongly associated with problematic behavioral tendencies like addiction and FoMO. Researchers' opinions attributed these tendencies to upwards social comparison and envy enabled by consumed contents.\n\nOne notable limitation to the SMAQ study was the disproportionate sample of mostly young and females, which limits generalizability to the broader population. Other than that, the data set was limited to Facebook users and geographically restricted to the Ruhr region of Germany. This makes it difficult to extrapolate any observations to older adults, different cultural contexts, and our specific social media of choice, Instagram.\n\n Another referenced perspective is provided by the study “Are active and passive social media use related to mental health, wellbeing, and social support outcomes?”. This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 141 quantitative studies which studies correlations between social media use styles and 13 mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Using pooled effect sizes, Godard and Holtzman report that neither active nor passive use strongly predicts well being on average, with most effects being minute.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Active use has modest association with perceived social support and wellbeing, but also with slightly higher anxiety. Passive use showed overall weak associations but were more linked to worse emotional outcomes in general contexts. Crucially, this study highlights that demographic characteristics and contextual moderators, such as age and usage setting, have more substantial influence on outcomes. These findings show the importance of controlling for confounding factors rather than simplistic narratives like “active is good, passive is bad” which becomes a focus in guiding our project.\n\n A study that heavily grounded age as contextual moderator is Underwood’s expanded literature review which is specific to adolescents aged 10-19. Reviewing 16 peer-reviewed studies gathered from MEDLINE and PubMed via keyword search, the literature review concludes that both active and passive social media has positive association with negative mental health outcomes in adolescents.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) While evidence was insufficient to conclude that one style is categorically more harmful, this study shows the repeated importance of grounding research by age as observations of effects varied across different stages of adolescence. Our current study aims to control moderating factors by narrowing our analysis to Instagram usage among adults aged 18+. We target to examine both positive and negative wellbeing outcomes stretching beyond happiness and stress to include physical health factors like sleep and physical health while explicitly accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle confounders.\n",

    "We hypothesize that among adults aged 18+, higher passive social media consumption will be associated with higher self reported stress and lower self reported happiness, while higher active interaction will be associated with lower stress and higher happiness. This is because passive browsing tends to increase social comparison and rumination, whereas active interaction is more likely to involve social connection and support, which can buffer stress and improve mood."

  "# Data\n\n## 1) Ideal dataset\n\n### Unit of observation\n- One row per person, ideally with a time window attached.\n- Best case: repeated measures (same person measured multiple times), because it helps us separate “who they are” from “what they did this week.”\n\n### Variables we need (and why)\n\n#### Unique ID + timestamps\n- `user_id` (unique person ID)\n- `date` or `week_id` (so we know the time window)\n\n#### Main predictors (social media use style)\n- Passive consumption (examples): minutes scrolling/browsing, number of posts viewed, short-form video viewing time\n- Active interaction (examples): number of posts made, comments written, likes given, DMs/messages sent\n- Ideally we also have platform (TikTok/IG/X/Reddit/etc.), because usage meaning can differ by platform.\n\n#### Outcome variables (wellbeing)\n- Primary: self-reported stress, self-reported happiness\n- Optional if available: sleep (hours, sleep quality), basic physical health (self-rated health, fatigue), maybe mood indicators\n\n#### Controls (to reduce confounding)\n- Demographics: age, gender, education\n- Socioeconomic: income or proxy, employment status\n- Lifestyle: physical activity, work hours, student status (if relevant)\n- Optional but helpful: baseline mental health, personality/introversion (only if the dataset includes it)\n\n### How many observations we need (rough target + reasoning)\n- Goal: enough data so regression estimates are stable after adding controls.\n- A practical target:\n  - At least ~1,000 people for a basic model (passive + active + a handful of controls).\n  - Better: 3,000–10,000 people if we want to test subgroups (e.g., different age groups) or add more controls without the model becoming unstable.\n- If we have repeated measures (daily/weekly rows per person), then the “number of rows” can be large even if the number of people is smaller — but we still want a solid number of unique people for generalizable results.\n\n### Ideal data collection method (in a perfect world)\n- Best-quality approach is a hybrid:\n  - Phone/app logs to capture passive vs active behavior accurately (reduces memory bias), and\n  - Short surveys for stress/happiness and sleep/health.\n- If logs aren’t possible, then a well-designed survey can still work, but it’s more prone to self-report error.\n\n### How the data would be stored/organized\n- Use “tidy” structure:\n  - Each row = one person in one time window (person-week or person-day)\n  - Columns = predictors/outcomes/controls\n- Keys:\n  - Primary key could be (user_id, date/week_id) if repeated measures exist.\n- Missingness handling plan:\n  - Track missing values explicitly (don’t silently drop without checking).\n  - If only a small amount is missing, we can use listwise deletion (drop rows) but we must report how many rows we dropped.\n  - If missingness is larger, consider simple imputation (only if allowed / appropriate) and run sensitivity checks.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Real dataset sources (5 Sources)\n\nWe propose use dataset 1 for our main analysis, and treat dataset 2 to 5 as backup/validation datasets (or to strengthen the “real data sources” part of the proposal).\n\n### Dataset 1 (Main): Kaggle — Social Media User Activity Dataset\nThis is our primary dataset because it is directly designed around social media activity and includes wellbeing outcomes aligned with our research question. The dataset is expected to let us measure both passive and active social media behaviors and relate them to stress/happiness, while controlling for demographics and lifestyle variables when available. Access is straightforward for students because it is hosted on Kaggle, and we can download it manually or use the Kaggle API after setting up credentials. A key limitation is that Kaggle datasets often rely on self-reported or synthetic/compiled data, so we will clearly describe what the dataset represents once we inspect the included documentation and column names.\n\n- **URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiajavedd/social-media-user-activity-dataset\n\n#### Access requirements\n- Kaggle account login\n- Accept Kaggle dataset terms\n- Optional: Kaggle API token if downloading in a notebook/script\n\n#### How it maps to our ideal dataset\n- Should contain: passive + active measures, wellbeing outcomes (stress/happiness), and at least some controls (we will confirm exact columns when we load the CSV)\n\n#### Main gaps / how we handle\n- If missing timestamps: treat it as cross-sectional (one row per person) and avoid time-based claims\n- If missing key controls: we’ll use what exists and clearly state remaining confounding risk\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 2: Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study) — social media “looking” vs “posting”\nThis dataset is useful because it includes survey measures that separate looking at social networking sites (a passive-like behavior) from posting on social networking sites (an active-like behavior). That matches our “passive vs active” concept well, and it is paired with many wellbeing and background variables commonly used in social science (e.g., mental health and demographics). Access requires registering through the UK Data Service, which is extra steps compared to Kaggle, but still realistic for a university project. A limitation is that it is UK-based and the exact wellbeing measures may differ from “stress/happiness,” so we may need to use related outcomes (e.g., psychological distress or life satisfaction) if we use it for replication.\n\n- **URL:** https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/\n\n#### Access requirements:\n- Registration (typically through the UK Data Service)\n- Agree to an End User License (EUL) / academic use conditions\n\n#### Important variables (examples):\n- `smlook` (frequency of looking at social networking sites)\n- `smpost` (frequency of posting on social networking sites)\n- Plus many demographic/SES variables and wellbeing/mental health measures\n\n#### Main gaps / how we handle\n- Different country + potentially different outcome measures → treat as “validation/replication,” not a direct replacement for our main dataset\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 3: CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) — social media use + health/wellbeing proxies\nYRBSS is a strong backup because it is a large, public, well-documented survey and includes youth health and wellbeing-related variables (mental health indicators, sleep, physical activity, etc.). It can support analysis linking amount/frequency of social media use to wellbeing-related outcomes, especially if we want a well-known, credible dataset source. However, it typically won’t separate passive vs active usage in detail, so it is better as a “bigger picture” comparison dataset rather than a perfect match. Access is easy: CDC provides documentation and data downloads.\n\n- **URL:** https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/index.html\n\n#### Access requirements\n- Public access (no API key needed); follow CDC data use guidance\n\n#### Important variables (typical categories)\n- Social media use frequency/time (when included in that survey year)\n- Sleep and physical activity variables (commonly included)\n- Mental health-related indicators (commonly included)\n\n#### Main gaps / how we handle\n- Teen-focused (not all ages) + limited “active vs passive” detail → use for robustness checks only, and keep conclusions narrow\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 4: Kaggle - Social Media and Mental Health\nThis dataset is helpful because it is directly about social media usage and mental health/wellbeing, and it is easy to access and analyze in a class setting. It can provide alternative measures of wellbeing (mental health indicators) and usage (time spent / habits), which can be used to check whether patterns match our main dataset’s results. Kaggle access is simple (download or API), which makes it “low friction” for the project timeline. A limitation is that the exact definitions of variables may not perfectly match our passive vs active definitions, so we would map the closest available variables and be explicit about the mismatch.\n\n- **URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health\n\n#### Access requirements\n- Kaggle login + terms acceptance\n- Optional Kaggle API token for programmatic download\n\n#### Main gaps / how we handle\n- If “passive vs active” is not explicit → create proxy variables (e.g., scrolling time as passive; posting/commenting frequency as active) only if the dataset supports it\n\n---\n\n### Dataset 5: GitHub project (data description) — Social Media Usage & Emotional Well-Being (columns include posts/likes/comments/messages)\nThis source is useful because it clearly lists a clean set of activity variables that match our active vs passive framing: daily usage time (passive-ish exposure) plus posts, likes, comments, and messages (active interaction). It also includes an emotion/wellbeing-related outcome field (dominant emotion), so it can be used as an additional dataset to test similar relationships even if the outcome is not exactly “stress/happiness.” This can strengthen our proposal by showing we have multiple realistic dataset options with the right activity structure. A limitation is that it may not include the exact control variables we want (SES/lifestyle), so it is best as a “supporting dataset,” not the main one.\n\n- **URL:** https://github.com/JamshedAli18/Social-Media-Usage-and-Emotional-Well-Being-Analysis\n\n#### Important variables (as listed)\n- `Daily_Usage_Time` (minutes) (passive exposure proxy)\n- `Posts_Per_Day`, `Likes_Received_Per_Day`, `Comments_Received_Per_Day`, `Messages_Sent_Per_Day` (active interaction proxies)\n\n#### Main gaps / how we handle\n- Outcome is emotion category (not stress/happiness) and controls may be limited to use only as secondary/illustrative analysis"
