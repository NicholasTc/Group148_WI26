    "How are different styles of social media use, passive consumption versus active interaction, associated with wellbeing outcomes among adults aged 18+? We define passive consumption as behaviors like time spent browsing content and viewing posts or short form videos, and active interaction as behaviors like posting, commenting, liking, and direct messaging. Our primary wellbeing outcomes are self reported stress and self reported happiness, and we will also examine sleep related and basic physical health indicators when available. To reduce confounding in this observational study, we will control for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle variables such as physical activity and work hours. We will use regression based statistical inference to estimate associations and will avoid causal claims."

    "Social media uses are now a major component of everyday life. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Snapchat have accrued daily engagement of the majority of adults. As social media use has grown, research has shifted towards focusing on the manner in which individuals engage with it. For this study, we are using a widely adopted distinction which identifies active interaction as including posting content, commenting, liking, and direct messaging. On the other hand, passive consumption includes browsing feeds or watching short-term videos Our initial research suggests that these usage styles may influence different psychological mechanisms with passive use often linked to social comparison and envy, while active use may have higher perceived support and social connectedness. However, associations with other wellbeing outcomes including stress, happiness, sleep quality, and physical health remain mixed and motivates further investigation.\n\nOne prior influential effort in this study is the Social Media Activity Questionnaire (SMAQ), which surveyed 1,230 participants derived from Facebook Activity Questionnaire. This study by Ozimek, Brailovskaia and Bierhoff separated actions identified as active and passive engagements with a rating scale from 1 to 5.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) With the application of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify behavioral dimensions, outcomes regarding mental health were assessed using established scales. These include Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) scale, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). In contrast to our project, this study focused on negative mental health indicators, rather than trying to estimate well being directly which remains  our priority. Research outcome displayed stronger association between active use depression, anxiety and stress, while passive was more strongly associated with problematic behavioral tendencies like addiction and FoMO. Researchers' opinions attributed these tendencies to upwards social comparison and envy enabled by consumed contents.\n\nOne notable limitation to the SMAQ study was the disproportionate sample of mostly young and females, which limits generalizability to the broader population. Other than that, the data set was limited to Facebook users and geographically restricted to the Ruhr region of Germany. This makes it difficult to extrapolate any observations to older adults, different cultural contexts, and our specific social media of choice, Instagram.\n\n Another referenced perspective is provided by the study “Are active and passive social media use related to mental health, wellbeing, and social support outcomes?”. This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 141 quantitative studies which studies correlations between social media use styles and 13 mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Using pooled effect sizes, Godard and Holtzman report that neither active nor passive use strongly predicts well being on average, with most effects being minute.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Active use has modest association with perceived social support and wellbeing, but also with slightly higher anxiety. Passive use showed overall weak associations but were more linked to worse emotional outcomes in general contexts. Crucially, this study highlights that demographic characteristics and contextual moderators, such as age and usage setting, have more substantial influence on outcomes. These findings show the importance of controlling for confounding factors rather than simplistic narratives like “active is good, passive is bad” which becomes a focus in guiding our project.\n\n A study that heavily grounded age as contextual moderator is Underwood’s expanded literature review which is specific to adolescents aged 10-19. Reviewing 16 peer-reviewed studies gathered from MEDLINE and PubMed via keyword search, the literature review concludes that both active and passive social media has positive association with negative mental health outcomes in adolescents.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) While evidence was insufficient to conclude that one style is categorically more harmful, this study shows the repeated importance of grounding research by age as observations of effects varied across different stages of adolescence. Our current study aims to control moderating factors by narrowing our analysis to Instagram usage among adults aged 18+. We target to examine both positive and negative wellbeing outcomes stretching beyond happiness and stress to include physical health factors like sleep and physical health while explicitly accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle confounders.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that among adults aged 18+, higher passive social media consumption will be associated with higher self reported stress and lower self reported happiness, while higher active interaction will be associated with lower stress and higher happiness. This is because passive browsing tends to increase social comparison and rumination, whereas active interaction is more likely to involve social connection and support, which can buffer stress and improve mood."
